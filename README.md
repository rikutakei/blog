# Blog

This is a repository that contains the static contents for the blog.

The blogs  are created with Rmarkdown and normal markdown files, using the `blogdown` package in R (for the ones with R codes) and Hugo.

For the deployment of the webpage, I will be using netlify to keep track of this repository for automatic deployment.
