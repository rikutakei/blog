      <description>Introduction In my last post, I wrote about modes in Vim and how to save and quit out of Vim, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t touch on how to move around Vim.
You might ask, &amp;ldquo;Why would I want to learn how to move around in Vim when you can just use the mouse and arrow keys?&amp;rdquo;
There are a couple of reasons why you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t (or perhaps can&amp;rsquo;t) use the mouse or arrow keys.</description>

      <description>Introduction Alright, so you&amp;rsquo;ve decided that learning Vim was worth your precious time (and you&amp;rsquo;ve made the right choice).
But where do you begin?
Google is usually a good place to begin your search of &amp;ldquo;How do I learn Vim&amp;rdquo;. And it will probably tell you to go to a random Vim emulator website and/or tell you to fire up vimtutor on the command line to &amp;ldquo;get used to Vim&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>So, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Hugo to generate this blog, and I thought I would make a Makefile to compile and clean up the working directory.
&amp;nbsp;
As you know, Hugo is pretty damn easy to use &amp;ndash; so easy that even I can make my own blog. So it is quite natural that you ask:
 &amp;ldquo;Why the hell would you make a Makefile for such a simple task?&amp;rdquo;
 The answer to that is:</description>

      <title>Vim Post Part 0: Should I Learn Vim?</title>

      <description>Introduction Vim is awesome.
It&amp;rsquo;s fast, &amp;ldquo;robust&amp;rdquo;, and it&amp;rsquo;s always there when you need it the most.
I was first introduced to Vim in my first year of MSc. It took me weeks and perhaps months of struggling and Google searching to become proficient in it, but I have no regret learning how to use it.
Of course, there are other editors out there like Atom, nano and Emacs, and you should pick the one that suits you the best.</description>
