Hi there, I&rsquo;m Riku.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m an Assistant Research Fellow at the University of Otago, working on projects geared towards Bioinformatics.
I have worked with a variety of data during my Masters and my current job, including microarrays, RNA-seq, genotype data, and methylation microarray data.</p>

<p>I think I&rsquo;m pretty good with using terminal and programming, but I&rsquo;d say I&rsquo;m better at using Google.
I mainly work on a Mac/Unix computer (<code>ssh</code>ing into a RHEL server, or a NeSI computer), and have Arch Linux running at home.
No, I don&rsquo;t use Windows &ndash; ditched that shite of an OS since 2014 and I&rsquo;m <em><strong>never</strong></em> going back.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve got a bad habit where, when I get interested in something, I <em>really</em> get into it until I get a good idea of how it works or become (relatively) good at it.
Past examples include: Vim, LaTeX, and this website/blog (Hugo).
So if you find something cool or interesting, let me know <em><strong>ASAP</strong></em>.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I hope you enjoy reading some of my posts, and if you learn something new from it, that&rsquo;ll make my day.</p>

<h1 id="background">Background</h1>

<p>I graduated from the University of Otago with a Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry in 2014, and during my three years of undergrad study, I have also been taking Computer Science papers (which I <em>thought</em> I had a Minor in, but I didn&rsquo;t &ndash; awkward ðŸ˜•).</p>

<p>Turns out programming skills and basic computer knowledge are actually quite useful in the field of biology, and so I decided to carry on with my study at Otago doing a Master of Science in Biochemistry, working on an entirely bioinformatic project.</p>

<p>Fast-forward two years &ndash; after a terrible interview with my future bosses, I somehow managed to get a job as an Assistant Research Fellow at the same University, and started working as I was finishing writing up my thesis.
That was a bit stressful, but that&rsquo;s what you get for overestimating your writing ability.</p>

<p>Currently, I am a year into my first job and enjoy working as a researcher/programmer, and just pondering everyday about what to do in the future.
Like what to get for lunch, or what to make for dinner.
Secure job? PhD? Nah, they can wait &ndash; I&rsquo;ll eventually get around to it.</p>
